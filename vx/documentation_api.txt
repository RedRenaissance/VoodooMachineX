//
//			This is a documentation/readme about the standard api
//			included with the VoodooMachineX.exe as extensionless files.
//
//			Author: Ruben Brouwer
//
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//			1.	What and why
//
It may be noted that since VoodooMachine.exe provides some functions as-is, without any
necessary include statements, a second library or API might be redundant.
The reasons for this are several. First of all, the functions are written in C, and either
partially or completely mimic C standard library and Windows API calls. So for example
reading a simple text file this way might look something like:

			var myString = null
			var myFile = _vx_fopen_(myDir, "r")
			
			while(myString = _vx_read_(myFile))
			{
				//Do something here.
			}
			_vx_fclose_(myFile_)
			
While this is of course possible, maybe even desirable in certain situations,
The API written around the VoodooMachineX.exe provides easier and more intuitive ways
to achieve such tasks, hiding a lot of the C style functionality from the user.
Furthermore, since these "native" calls communicate directly to the machine,
misuse or erroneous use, for example providing too few arguments to such functions,
can cause unpredictable behaviour or program crashes.
The extra library files provide a nice way of doing this in a modern object oriented style:

			vxInclude("C://vx/vxFile")
			
			var myFile = new vxFile(myDir).open()
			
			doSomething(myFile.getText())
			
Similarly, a considerable part of typical WindowsAPI "boilerplate" code
for writing graphical user interfaces has been hidden from the user.
With aforementioned considerations in mind, each object is organised
in its own extensionless file, by exatly the name of the object in question.
For example vxFile in "vxFile", vxSound in "vxSound" for playing sound files,
vxCon in "vxCon" which provides a console object, and so on and so forth.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//			2.	Importing the API
//
The VoodooMachineX.exe is, first of all, very simple at entry-point. It checks if arguments
are given to the program, then it tries to open a flat-text file by that directory and execute it.
It only assumes one file for entry point.
If no arguments are given to the program, it will simply display a message box and quit.
In order to do any real-world programming, however, it would of course be vital to be able to
include/import certain functions and objects. It would be possible to write a script handling 
a text file in a C-like manner, given the functionality provided, but since this would be
cumbersome, a shortcut is provided in "_vx_include_" and "vxInclude", which are *exactly the same*,
as it is only an alias.
Note that they are *functions* and not special directives. They take a directory string as argument.
Hence we could for example write:

			vxInclude("C://vx/vxLib")
			
Here, the file "vxLib" will be grabbed from the directory, then, executed as javascript.
VoodooMachineX does not have any special reading mode for this include statement,
it reads it as any other code send through the interpreter. "vxLib" is a file simply including
*all* other library files, as a simple shorthand.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//			3.	vxCon
//
The first and probably most primitive way of writing a program would of course be the console window,
VoodooMachineX wouldn't be any fun if this wasn't possible!
The File "vxCon" provides a console object with useful functions mapped into it.
For example, the classic hello world program would for example be written as:

			vxInclude("C://vx/vxCon")		//Read the file.
			var con = new vxCon()			//Create a new console object
			con.print("Hello, world!\n")	//Print the line "Hello, world!"
			con.system("pause")				//Pause the program (wait for a keypress)
			con.close()						//Close the console.

Full constructor:
	vxCon()

The following functions are provided by the vxCon object:

open
	Opens the console. This is done by default at creation of the object,
	but can be called again in the case it is closed in the meantime.
	Takes no arguments.
close
	Closes the console. Takes no arguments.
putChar
	Puts a char through the standard output stream.
getChar
	Gets a char from the standard input stream.
print
	Prints a line to the standard output stream.
	Takes one string as an argument in such a way that
		myConsole.print("Hello, world!\n")
	is equivalent to the C call
		printf("Hello, world!\n")
read
	Reads a line from the standard input stream.
	Takes no arguments.
system
	Makes a cmd call to the OS. Takes a string as an argument.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//			4.	vxFrame
//
Although the windows GUI functionality is still being expanded, the vxFrame object
provides a nice way of writing GUI's while hiding the more cumbersome WindowsAPI calls.
For example, a simple window loop would be written as:

			vxInclude("C://vx/vxFrame")
			
			var myFrame = new vxFrame(caption, x, y, width, hight, style)
			
			myFrame.setVisible(true)
			
			while(myFrame.getMessage())
			{
				myFrame.handleMessage()
				
				if(myFrame.hasCloseMessage()) break
			}
			myFrame.destroy()

An astute observer might note this functions indeed just "wrap" most of the Windows API
specifics that go into creating such a frame and message loop, while being functionally equivalent.
With objects explained later in this document, elements can be added such as a vxButton:

		myFrame.add(myButton)

With which we can write into the message loop:

		if(myButton.isActivated())
		{
			//Do something.
		}

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//			5.	vxDialog
//
vxDialog provides a convenient way to show message boxes.
It is created as
			new vxDialog(caption, text, style)
Where the result of mouse clicks is stored in a variable called "result".
However, if instead of a caption, either vxOpen or vxSave are passed as arguments,
this creates open and save dialogs respectively, and the result will be the directory specified.
Example:
			var myDialog = new vxDialog("Wait...", "Do you want to save this text?", vxYesNo)
			
			if(myDialog.yesClicked())
			{
				var mySaveDialog = new vxDialog(vxSave)
				
				var myFile = new vxFile(mySaveDialog.result).setText(myText).save()
			}

Full constructor:
	vxDialog(caption, text, style)
The following functions are provided by the vxDialog object:

yesClicked
	Returns true if the yes button was clicked. Takes no arguments.
noClicked
	Returns true if the no button was clicked. Takes no arguments.
cancelClicked
	Returns true if the cancel button was clicked. Takes no arguments.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//			6.	vxButton
//
vxButton is a wrapper of a GUI button element to be used in conjunction with vxFrame.
All the information pertaining to a certain button is as such held by a vxButton object,
whereas vxFrame handles all the extra backend operations such as the creation of HWND objects.
Example:
			var myFrame = new vxFrame("myProgram", 0, 0, 500, 200)
			var myButton = new vxButton("Click me", 20, 20, 100, 30)
			
			myFrame.add(myButton)
			myFrame.setVisible(true)
			
			while(myFrame.getMessage())
			{
				myFrame.handleMessage()
				
				if(myButton.isActivated())
				{
					//Do something.
				}
				//...
			}

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//			11.	vxFile
//
vxFile provides an intuitive way of dealing with files. Instead of much ado with
opened and closed files, this one mimics this functionality while copying the contents into a buffer.
This should provide an extra layer of safety to prevent undesirable effects to files when errors occur.

Full constructor:

vxFile(filePath)

The following functions are provided by the vxFile object:

open
	"opens" the file. What really goes on the in the backend is the file is opened, 
	its contents are stored in this object, and it is closed again leaving the contents in the buffer.
	Takes no arguments.
close
destroy
	These two are the same. Make this empty. Takes no arguments.
setDir
	Sets the directory to the given string argument.
save
	In conjunct with "open" this one is intuitive. What it does is it opens a file, empties it,
	writes its buffer into it and closes it again. Takes no arguments.
append
	This will open a file, append the buffer to the end of it, and close it again.
setText
	Changes the buffer text to a given argument string.
getText
	Get the text in the buffer.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//			12.	vxProcess
//
vxProcess hides some more tedious backend stuff related to multithreading from the user.

Full constructor:
	vxProcess(adress)
	If no adress to a process is given, this will create one on the spot.

The following functions are provided by the vxProcess object:

destroy
	Destroys the adress and frees allocated memory. Takes no arguments.
loadup
	Loads a string of text into this object as if it were. Assumes it is Javascript.
	Takes only a string argument.
run
	Runs the given bit of javascript code as a seperate thread.
	Takes a string as an argument, if no string is given, it runs whatever code
	is stored in the object.
isActive
	Returns true if this thread is busy. Takes no arguments.
passInt
	Passes an int as a variable to this thread.
	Takes a name string and a number as arguments respectively.
passUint
	Passes an unsigned int as a variable to this thread.
	Takes a name string and a number as arguments respectively.
passByte
	Passes an byte as a variable to this thread.
	Takes a name string and a number as arguments respectively.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//

	Moves the mouse along x and y coordinates relative to its current position.
The following functions take no arguments and should be self-explanatory:
rightDown
rightUp
rightClick
leftDown
leftUp
leftClick
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//			14.	vxKeyboard
//
Provides a way to simulate keyboard input using windows virtual keycodes.

keyDown
	Simulate a keydown.
	Takes key code for argument.
keyUp
	Simulates a key release.
	Takes key code for argument.
keyType
	Simulates a single key typed. In other words, wraps down and up.
	Takes key code for argument.
keyString
	Takes a string as an argument and types them in sequence.
