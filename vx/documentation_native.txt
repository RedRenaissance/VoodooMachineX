			Takes a number as a memory adress to write at and
			a number as a value to write in it.
			Example:
						_vx_put_word_(myPointer, 33);
_vx_put_dword_
			Takes a number as a memory adress to write at and
			a number as a value to write in it.

_vx_get_byte_
_vx_get_word_
_vx_get_dword_
_vx_get_int_
_vx_get_double_
_vx_get_string_
			All these functions get the item as self explanatory
			from the adress given. For example, assuming x is an
			adress _vx_get_int_(x) will read off an integer from
			the first four bytes. _vx_get_int_(x+4) will read it 
			from an offset of 4 bytes, etc.
			Note that the _vx_get_string_ function assumes a C string
			and so it will keep fetching information until 0
_vx_get_static_
			Gets the adress of the static space. Default is 0,
			meaning nothing has been assigned yet.
			Example:
						_vx_free_(_vx_get_static_());
